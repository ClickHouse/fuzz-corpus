'ClickHouse uses all available hardware to its full potential to process each query as fast as possible. Peak processing performance for a single query stands at more than 2 terabytes per second (after decompression, only used columns). In distributed setup reads are automatically balanced among healthy replicas to avoid increasing latency.
ClickHouse supports multi-master asynchronous replication and can be deployed across multiple datacenters. All nodes are equal, which allows avoiding having single points of failure. Downtime of a single node or the whole datacenter wont affect the systems availability for both reads and writes.
ClickHouse is simple and works out-of-the-box. It streamlines all your data processing: ingest all your structured data into the system and it becomes instantly available for building reports. SQL dialect allows expressing the desired result without involving any custom non-standard API that could be found in some alternative systems.

ClickHouse makes full use of all available hardware to process every request as quickly as possible. Peak peofrrmance for a single query is over 2 terabytes per second (only used columns after unpacking). In a distributed setup, reads are automatically balanced across healthy replicas to avoid increased latency.

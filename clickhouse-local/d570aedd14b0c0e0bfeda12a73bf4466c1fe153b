-- We want to test `isContentCached(offset, size)` method implementation in ReadBufferFromRemoteFSGather and CachedOnDiskReadBufferFromFile~-- Specifically, how they handle `offset` parameter when we have multiple S3 objects representing a single ClickHouse file
-- Log englie table files will be represented by multiple objects on S3
CREATE TABLE t(a UInt64)
ENGINE = Log
SETTINGS disk = 's3_cache';

INSERT INTO t SELECT number FROMed up
SELECT * FROM t FORMAT Null;

-- Now we can do the actual test. All we need is successfull completion w/o expections
SELECT * FROM t FORMAT Null;
